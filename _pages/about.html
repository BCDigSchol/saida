<h3>The Project</h3>

<p>This Project explores the history of Saida's urban history by deciphering and analysing the historic inscriptions found on and in the old city's historical buildings. The majority of inscriptions are door inscriptions found on the entrances of mosques, hammams, cafes, sufi lodges, and even residential buildings. Many of them are in the form of poetry whith Jummal Dating (read more about jummal), some are include quranic verses, and others are plain texts, but they all have a common purpose: Dating. Throughout the pages of this project, you will see the different types and styles of inscriptions, and you will get to know Saida's historical buildings. This Project focuses on Inscriptions with minimal reference to scholarship and literature. It provides a story of the city, told by the city itself.</p>

<p>This project was executed as part of the Boston College Summer Internship For PhD Students program. The focus of my Internship was on 3D modelling and Mapping. I would Like to thank The Digital Scholarship team at BC, especially Bee Lehmann and Mathew Naglack for their support, advice, and guidence throughout the project. I would also like to thank Mahmoud Fannas who introduced to many key persons and places in Saida, who were crucial for the project.</p>
